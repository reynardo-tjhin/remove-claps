Description: <br>
Using basic Machine Learning techniques to remove hand claps from a music performance audio

Problem Statement: <br>
This solution comes from when I want to listen to classical music performances offline (after downloading them, typically as mp3). However, in most of the classical music performances, there are three sections in the video: the first section is when the audiences are clapping for when the musician comes to perform which is then followed by a quiet time when the musicians are preparing, the second section is when the music is playing and finally the last section is when the music ends and the audience cheers for the musicians for their amazing performances.

Dataset:


CHANGE IDEA:
1. Find a way to speed up the splitting time
2. Improve dataset => In a performance (yes: claps vs no: others)
3. (Optional) Find other features that may help
