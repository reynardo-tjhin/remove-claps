Description: <br>
Using Artificial Intelligence to remove hand claps from a music performance audio

Problem Statement: TODO


Dataset:


CHANGE IDEA:
1. Find a way to speed up the splitting time
2. Improve dataset => In a performance (yes: claps vs no: others)
3. (Optional) Find other features that may help
